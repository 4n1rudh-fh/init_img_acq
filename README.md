# Description
- This repo contains source code to perform initial image acquisition using Mako G-040 Camera from Allied Vision.
- It saves the captured images inside the 'images' folder.
- The timestamps are saved inside the 'timestamps' folder.

# Steps to follow
```
# create build and lib directory inside the repo folder
mkdir -p build lib

```

# To-Do
- Add instructions for ZLIB 
- Add instructions for VimbaCPP
- Add instructions for XLSXWRITER
- Or just make a new folder where you tell the user to copy the libraries from. But ZLIB and OpenCV instructions are still necessary.
